design and develop a solution to automate our current workflow while keeping scalability in mind. The admin panel will serve as both a CRM and dispatching solution, consolidating our current processes into one platform.

Our Current Workflow:
- Customer Inquiries: Enquiries received via WhatsApp Business.
- Ride Scheduling: Dispatchers manually schedule rides using Google Calendar.
- Ride Tracking: Ongoing rides tracked using Google Sheets.
- Payments: Payment links sent to customers via Stripe.


What We Need:
A web-based admin panel with the following features:

A. CRM Features:
- Customer Management: Centralized database of customer information, past inquiries, and ride history.
- Enquiry Management: Integrate with WhatsApp Business API to capture, organize, and respond to inquiries directly from the panel (possibly automate whatsapp bot responses to customer).
- Payment Integration: Generate and send Stripe payment links automatically from the panel, with payment status updates.

B. Dispatching Features:
- Ride Scheduling: Replace Google Calendar with a ride scheduling system that allows dispatchers to assign rides to drivers seamlessly.
- Driver Management: Maintain a driver roster, track availability, and assign rides based on schedules or proximity.
- (Optional) Ride Tracking: Real-time tracking of rides and their statuses, with notifications for dispatchers, drivers, and customers.
- (Optional) Notifications: Send automated WhatsApp or SMS notifications to drivers and customers at key points (ride assigned, driver en route, ride completed).

C. Automation Requirements:
- Automatically move inquiries from WhatsApp to the CRM.
- Enable dispatchers to assign rides with just a few clicks.
- Update ride statuses in real time, visible to all stakeholders.
- Trigger Stripe payment link generation and track payment confirmations within the panel.

D. Tech Requirements:
- Integration: WhatsApp Business API, Google Maps API (for driver routing), Stripe API.
- Backend: Open to suggestions.
- Frontend: Simple, responsive UI for dispatchers and drivers.
- Database: Secure storage of customer, driver, and ride data.
- Notifications: SMS or WhatsApp message integration for real-time updates.

E. Timeline & Budget:
We are looking for a quick turnaround on this project (4-6 weeks). The solution should be lightweight, efficient, and cost-effective. Please provide an estimated timeline and cost in your proposal.
